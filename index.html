            Jose Hernandes, as a professor of Statistics at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Guadalajara, I can assure you that Jonathan Samuel Santiago Cardenas, while he was taking the course of his studies, was a very responsible student, skilled in the most complicated statistical calculations. and with a lot of motivation to carry them out.
            
            The works that he gave me, both group and individual, were always delivered within the deadline and I ended up scoring excellent. I was surprised myself as a teacher, since Jonathan looked for information in all kinds of sources and poured very interesting approaches into his work.
            
            His behavior as a student was also excellent, always arriving on time and fulfilling his commitments, aspects that make him a very valuable person for any work team.
            
            I am available to give more information if necessary.
